8ball Pool

This is basically asteroids, but the asteroids are balls, and the ship is a pool stick!

I reused my asteroids code for this, since it already had matter.js going, and changed the asteroids to balls, and the ship into a 360 degree rotational stick. Otherwise, like asteroids, there's no gravity - because you're looking top-down - and objects can collide and bounce around.
